By combining these sorbents with mild heat, the researchers can harvest gallons of drinkable water out of the atmosphere, even in dry conditions.\\n\\n\"With this breakthrough, we\\'ve created a universal molecular engineering strategy that allows diverse natural materials to be transformed into high-efficiency sorbents,\" said Guihua Yu, a professor of materials science and mechanical engineering and Texas Materials Institute at UT Austin. \"This opens up an entirely new way to think about sustainable water collection, marking a big step towards practical water harvesting systems for households and small community scale.\"\\n\\nIn field tests, the researchers generated 14.19 liters (3.75 gallons) of clean water per kilogram of sorbent daily. Most sorbents can generate between 1 and 5 liters per kilogram per day.\\n\\nThe new research was published in Advanced Materials.\\n\\nThis system represents a new way of designing sorbents, the researchers say. Instead of the traditional \"select-and-combine\" approach, which requires picking specific materials for specific functions, this general molecular strategy makes it possible to turn almost any biomass into an efficient water harvester.\\n\\nUnlike existing synthetic sorbents, which use petrochemicals and generally require high energy inputs, the UT Austin team\\'s biomass-based hydrogel is biodegradable, scalable, and requires minimal energy to release water. The secret lies in a two-step molecular engineering process that imparts hygroscopic properties and thermoresponsive behavior to any biomass-based polysaccharide, such as cellulose, starch, or chitosan.\\n\\n\"At the end of the day, clean water access should be simple, sustainable, and scalable,\" said Weixin Guan, a senior doctoral student and the study\\'s lead researcher. \"This material gives us a way to tap into nature\\'s most abundant resources and make water from air -- anytime, anywhere.\"\\n\\nThe latest innovation is part of Yu\\'s years-long quest to develop solutions for people lacking access to clean drinking water. He\\'s developed water-generating hydrogels throughout his career, adapting them for the driest conditions. He recently created an injectable water filtration system, and he has applied his hydrogel technology to farming.\\n\\nThe research team is now working on scaling production and designing real-world device systems for commercialization, including portable water harvesters, self-sustaining irrigation systems, and emergency drinking water devices. Since the beginning, the researchers have focused on scalability and the ability to translate this research into solutions that can help people around the world.\\n\\n\"The biggest challenge in sustainable water harvesting is developing a solution that scales up efficiently and remains practical outside the lab,\" said Yaxuan Zhao, a graduate researcher in Yu\\'s lab. \"Since this hydrogel can be fabricated from widely available biomass and operates with minimal energy input, it has strong potential for large-scale production and deployment in off-grid communities, emergency relief efforts, and decentralized water systems.\"', 'review': 'Researchers at UT Austin have developed an innovative system using \"molecularly functionalized biomass hydrogels\" to efficiently harvest water from the atmosphere, even in arid conditions.

However, these systems do create radioactive waste, which can be dangerous to human health and the environment. Safely disposing of this waste can be challenging.\\n\\nUsing a combination of scintillator crystals, high-density materials that emit light when they absorb radiation, and solar cells, the team, led by researchers from The Ohio State University, demonstrated that ambient gamma radiation could be harvested to produce a strong enough electric output to power microelectronics, like microchips.\\n\\nTo test this battery, which is a prototype about 4 cubic centimeters small, researchers used two different radioactive sources, cesium-137, and cobalt-60, some of the most significant fission products that come from spent nuclear fuel. The battery was tested at Ohio State\\'s Nuclear Reactor Laboratory. The NRL supports student and faculty research, student education, and service to industry -- it does not produce electrical power.\\n\\nTheir results showed that when cesium-137 was used, the battery generated 288 nanowatts. Yet with the much stronger isotope cobalt-60, the battery produced 1.5 microwatts of power, about enough to switch on a tiny sensor.\\n\\nAlthough most power outputs for homes and electronics are measured in kilowatts, this suggests that with the right power source, such devices could be scaled up to target applications at or beyond the watts level, said Raymond Cao, lead author of the study and a professor in mechanical and aerospace engineering at Ohio State.\\n\\nThe study was recently published in the journal Optical Materials: X.\\n\\nThe researchers said these batteries would be used near where the nuclear waste is produced, such as in nuclear waste storage pools or nuclear systems for space and deep sea exploration -- they aren\\'t designed for public use. Fortunately, although the gamma radiation utilized in this work is about a hundred times more penetrating than a normal X-ray or CT scan, the battery itself does not incorporate radioactive materials, meaning it is still safe to touch.\\n\\n\"We\\'re harvesting something considered as waste and by nature, trying to turn it into treasure,\" said Cao, who also serves as the director of Ohio State\\'s Nuclear Reactor Lab.\\n\\nAccording to the study, the team\\'s battery may also have experienced an increase in power due to the makeup of the prototype scintillator crystal the team opted to use. They found that even the shape and size of the crystals can impact the final electrical output, as a larger volume allows it to absorb more radiation and convert that extra energy into more light. A larger surface area also helps the solar cell generate power.\\n\\n\"These are breakthrough results in terms of power output,\" said Ibrahim Oksuz, co-author of the study and a research associate in mechanical and aerospace engineering at Ohio State. \"This two-step process is still in its preliminary stages, but the next step involves generating greater watts with scale-up constructs.\"\\n\\nSince batteries of this type would most likely end up in environments where high levels of radiation already exist and aren\\'t easily accessible to the public, these long-lasting devices wouldn\\'t pollute their surroundings. Even more significantly, they could also operate without the need for routine maintenance.\\n\\nScaling this technology up would be costly unless these batteries could be reliably manufactured, said Cao. Further research is needed to assess the batteries\\' usefulness and limitations, including how long they might last once safely implemented, said Oksuz.\\n\\n\"The nuclear battery concept is very promising,\" he said. \"There\\'s still lots of room for improvement, but I believe in the future, this approach will carve an important space for itself in both the energy production and sensors industry.\"\\n\\nThis work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy\\'s National Nuclear Security Administration and the U.S. Department of Energy\\'s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.

For example, if quantum computers reduce the time and cost to produce new lifesaving therapeutic drugs, that is real societal impact.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuantum science and engineering at Purdue is a pillar of the Purdue Computes initiative, which is focused on advancing research in computing, physical AI, semiconductors and quantum technologies.\\n\\n\"This research breakthrough in the measurement of the state of quasi particles is a milestone in the development of topological quantum computing, and creates a watershed moment in the semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structure,\" Purdue President Mung Chiang said. \"Marking also the latest success in the strategic initiative of Purdue Computes, the deep collaboration that Professor Manfra and his team have created with the Microsoft Quantum Lab West Lafayette on the Purdue campus exemplifies the most impactful industry research partnership at any American university today.\"\\n\\nMost approaches to quantum computers rely on local degrees of freedom to encode information. The spin of an electron is a classic example of a qubit. But an individual spin is prone to disturbance -- by relatively common things like heat, vibrations or interactions with other quantum particles -- which can corrupt quantum information stored in the qubit, necessitating a great deal of effort in detecting and correcting errors. Instead of spin, topological quantum computers store information in a more distributed manner; the qubit state is encoded in the state of many particles acting in concert. Consequently, it is harder to scramble the information as the state of all the particles must be changed to alter the qubit state.\\n\\nIn the Nature paper, the Microsoft team was able to accurately and quickly measure the state of quasi particles that form the basis of the qubit.\\n\\n\"The device is used to measure a basic property of a topological qubit quickly,\" Manfra said. \"The team is excited to build on these positive results.\"\\n\\n\"The team in West Lafayette pushed existing epitaxial technology to a new state-of-the-art for semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structures to ensure a perfect interface between each of the building blocks of the Microsoft hybrid system,\" said Sergei Gronin, a Microsoft Quantum Lab scientist.\\n\\n\"The materials quality that is required for quantum computing chips necessitates constant improvements, so that\\'s one of the biggest challenges,\" Gronin said. \"First, we had to adjust and improve semiconductor technology to meet a new level that nobody was able to achieve before. But equally important was how to create this hybrid system. To do that, we had to merge a semiconducting part and a superconducting part. And that means you need to perfect the semiconductor and the superconductor and perfect the interface between them.\"\\n\\nWhile work discussed in the Nature article was performed by Microsoft employees, the exposure to industrial-scale research and development is an outstanding opportunity for Purdue students in Manfra\\'s academic group as well. John Watson, Geoffrey Gardner and Saeed Fallahi, who are among the coauthors of the paper, earned their doctoral degrees under Manfra and now work for Microsoft Quantum at locations in Redmond, Washington, and Copenhagen, Denmark. Most of Manfra\\'s former students now work for quantum computing companies, including Microsoft. Tyler Lindemann, who works in the West Lafayette lab and helped to build the hybrid semiconductor-superconductor structures required for the device, is earning a doctoral degree from Purdue under Manfra\\'s supervision.\\n\\n\"Working in Professor Manfra\\'s lab in conjunction with my work for Microsoft Quantum has given me a head start in my professional development, and been fruitful for my academic work,\" Lindemann said. \"At the same time, many of the world-class scientists and engineers at Microsoft Quantum have some background in academia, and being able to draw from their knowledge and experience is an indispensable resource in my graduate studies. From both perspectives, it\\'s a great opportunity.\"', 'review': \"This article highlights a significant breakthrough in quantum computing, achieved through the synergistic collaboration between Purdue University and Microsoft Quantum Lab.

By combining these sorbents with mild heat, the researchers can harvest gallons of drinkable water out of the atmosphere, even in dry conditions.\\n\\n\"With this breakthrough, we\\'ve created a universal molecular engineering strategy that allows diverse natural materials to be transformed into high-efficiency sorbents,\" said Guihua Yu, a professor of materials science and mechanical engineering and Texas Materials Institute at UT Austin. \"This opens up an entirely new way to think about sustainable water collection, marking a big step towards practical water harvesting systems for households and small community scale.\"\\n\\nIn field tests, the researchers generated 14.19 liters (3.75 gallons) of clean water per kilogram of sorbent daily. Most sorbents can generate between 1 and 5 liters per kilogram per day.\\n\\nThe new research was published in Advanced Materials.\\n\\nThis system represents a new way of designing sorbents, the researchers say. Instead of the traditional \"select-and-combine\" approach, which requires picking specific materials for specific functions, this general molecular strategy makes it possible to turn almost any biomass into an efficient water harvester.\\n\\nUnlike existing synthetic sorbents, which use petrochemicals and generally require high energy inputs, the UT Austin team\\'s biomass-based hydrogel is biodegradable, scalable, and requires minimal energy to release water.

However, these systems do create radioactive waste, which can be dangerous to human health and the environment. Safely disposing of this waste can be challenging.\\n\\nUsing a combination of scintillator crystals, high-density materials that emit light when they absorb radiation, and solar cells, the team, led by researchers from The Ohio State University, demonstrated that ambient gamma radiation could be harvested to produce a strong enough electric output to power microelectronics, like microchips.\\n\\nTo test this battery, which is a prototype about 4 cubic centimeters small, researchers used two different radioactive sources, cesium-137, and cobalt-60, some of the most significant fission products that come from spent nuclear fuel. The battery was tested at Ohio State\\'s Nuclear Reactor Laboratory. The NRL supports student and faculty research, student education, and service to industry -- it does not produce electrical power.\\n\\nTheir results showed that when cesium-137 was used, the battery generated 288 nanowatts. Yet with the much stronger isotope cobalt-60, the battery produced 1.5 microwatts of power, about enough to switch on a tiny sensor.\\n\\nAlthough most power outputs for homes and electronics are measured in kilowatts, this suggests that with the right power source, such devices could be scaled up to target applications at or beyond the watts level, said Raymond Cao, lead author of the study and a professor in mechanical and aerospace engineering at Ohio State.\\n\\nThe study was recently published in the journal Optical Materials: X.\\n\\nThe researchers said these batteries would be used near where the nuclear waste is produced, such as in nuclear waste storage pools or nuclear systems for space and deep sea exploration -- they aren\\'t designed for public use. Fortunately, although the gamma radiation utilized in this work is about a hundred times more penetrating than a normal X-ray or CT scan, the battery itself does not incorporate radioactive materials, meaning it is still safe to touch.\\n\\n\"We\\'re harvesting something considered as waste and by nature, trying to turn it into treasure,\" said Cao, who also serves as the director of Ohio State\\'s Nuclear Reactor Lab.\\n\\nAccording to the study, the team\\'s battery may also have experienced an increase in power due to the makeup of the prototype scintillator crystal the team opted to use. They found that even the shape and size of the crystals can impact the final electrical output, as a larger volume allows it to absorb more radiation and convert that extra energy into more light. A larger surface area also helps the solar cell generate power.\\n\\n\"These are breakthrough results in terms of power output,\" said Ibrahim Oksuz, co-author of the study and a research associate in mechanical and aerospace engineering at Ohio State. \"This two-step process is still in its preliminary stages, but the next step involves generating greater watts with scale-up constructs.\"\\n\\nSince batteries of this type would most likely end up in environments where high levels of radiation already exist and aren\\'t easily accessible to the public, these long-lasting devices wouldn\\'t pollute their surroundings. Even more significantly, they could also operate without the need for routine maintenance.\\n\\nScaling this technology up would be costly unless these batteries could be reliably manufactured, said Cao. Further research is needed to assess the batteries\\' usefulness and limitations, including how long they might last once safely implemented, said Oksuz.\\n\\n\"The nuclear battery concept is very promising,\" he said. \"There\\'s still lots of room for improvement, but I believe in the future, this approach will carve an important space for itself in both the energy production and sensors industry.\"\\n\\nThis work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy\\'s National Nuclear Security Administration and the U.S. Department of Energy\\'s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.

For example, if quantum computers reduce the time and cost to produce new lifesaving therapeutic drugs, that is real societal impact.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuantum science and engineering at Purdue is a pillar of the Purdue Computes initiative, which is focused on advancing research in computing, physical AI, semiconductors and quantum technologies.\\n\\n\"This research breakthrough in the measurement of the state of quasi particles is a milestone in the development of topological quantum computing, and creates a watershed moment in the semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structure,\" Purdue President Mung Chiang said. \"Marking also the latest success in the strategic initiative of Purdue Computes, the deep collaboration that Professor Manfra and his team have created with the Microsoft Quantum Lab West Lafayette on the Purdue campus exemplifies the most impactful industry research partnership at any American university today.\"\\n\\nMost approaches to quantum computers rely on local degrees of freedom to encode information. The spin of an electron is a classic example of a qubit. But an individual spin is prone to disturbance -- by relatively common things like heat, vibrations or interactions with other quantum particles -- which can corrupt quantum information stored in the qubit, necessitating a great deal of effort in detecting and correcting errors. Instead of spin, topological quantum computers store information in a more distributed manner; the qubit state is encoded in the state of many particles acting in concert. Consequently, it is harder to scramble the information as the state of all the particles must be changed to alter the qubit state.\\n\\nIn the Nature paper, the Microsoft team was able to accurately and quickly measure the state of quasi particles that form the basis of the qubit.\\n\\n\"The device is used to measure a basic property of a topological qubit quickly,\" Manfra said. \"The team is excited to build on these positive results.\"\\n\\n\"The team in West Lafayette pushed existing epitaxial technology to a new state-of-the-art for semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structures to ensure a perfect interface between each of the building blocks of the Microsoft hybrid system,\" said Sergei Gronin, a Microsoft Quantum Lab scientist.\\n\\n\"The materials quality that is required for quantum computing chips necessitates constant improvements, so that\\'s one of the biggest challenges,\" Gronin said. \"First, we had to adjust and improve semiconductor technology to meet a new level that nobody was able to achieve before. But equally important was how to create this hybrid system. To do that, we had to merge a semiconducting part and a superconducting part. And that means you need to perfect the semiconductor and the superconductor and perfect the interface between them.\"\\n\\nWhile work discussed in the Nature article was performed by Microsoft employees, the exposure to industrial-scale research and development is an outstanding opportunity for Purdue students in Manfra\\'s academic group as well. John Watson, Geoffrey Gardner and Saeed Fallahi, who are among the coauthors of the paper, earned their doctoral degrees under Manfra and now work for Microsoft Quantum at locations in Redmond, Washington, and Copenhagen, Denmark. Most of Manfra\\'s former students now work for quantum computing companies, including Microsoft. Tyler Lindemann, who works in the West Lafayette lab and helped to build the hybrid semiconductor-superconductor structures required for the device, is earning a doctoral degree from Purdue under Manfra\\'s supervision.\\n\\n\"Working in Professor Manfra\\'s lab in conjunction with my work for Microsoft Quantum has given me a head start in my professional development, and been fruitful for my academic work,\" Lindemann said. \"At the same time, many of the world-class scientists and engineers at Microsoft Quantum have some background in academia, and being able to draw from their knowledge and experience is an indispensable resource in my graduate studies.
