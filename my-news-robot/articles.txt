Date: Feb. 25, 2025 —
Summary: Feb. 25, 2025 — A bone marrow transplant process is safe and curative for adults with sickle cell disease, according to results of a trial completed at about 20 cancer ...

ChatGpt: This study highlights the promising results of reduced-intensity haploidentical bone marrow transplantation for severe sickle cell disease. With a 95% survival rate and 88% cure rate in the trial, it presents a compelling alternative to gene therapy, especially for adults who are ineligible for the latter due to high-dose chemotherapy risks. The procedure is more cost-effective and involves fewer hospitalizations and transfusions. These findings could significantly influence treatment options and accessibility for sickle cell patients.
